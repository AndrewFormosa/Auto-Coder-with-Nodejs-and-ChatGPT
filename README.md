# AutoCoder-with-Nodejs-and-ChatGPT
Welcome to my auto coder - Inspired by a video from Unconventional Coding who demonstrated one using Python, I wanted to give it a go with Nodejs.
This code gives chat gpt access to a folder in which it can read, write and delete files.
It asks the user for a project to work on and then loops through the various functions as it tries to achieve it.
It also asks for additional information when required.
You will need an OpenIA key and Nodejs to run.
To quit the program you can simply type quit at any time.
Have Fun!!..
